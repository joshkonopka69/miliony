# ü§ù Collaboration Guide - Avoiding Merge Conflicts

## üéØ **Goal: Smooth Parallel Development Without Conflicts**

This guide will help you and your friend work on the UI simultaneously without merge conflicts.

---

## üìã **Current Project Analysis**

### **High-Risk Files (Likely to have conflicts):**
- `src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx` - Currently open, UI changes likely
- `src/screens/MapScreen.tsx` - Core functionality, frequent changes
- `src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx` - Authentication UI
- `src/screens/WelcomeScreen.tsx` - Landing page
- `src/components/` - All component files
- `src/navigation/` - Navigation structure

### **Low-Risk Files (Safe to modify):**
- `src/services/` - Backend logic (you're working on auth)
- `src/contexts/` - Context providers
- `src/hooks/` - Custom hooks
- Configuration files

---

## üöÄ **Recommended Git Workflow**

### **Step 1: Create Feature Branches**

```bash
# You (working on authentication)
git checkout -b feature/authentication-setup
git add .
git commit -m "Add authentication setup and configuration"
git push origin feature/authentication-setup

# Your friend (working on UI)
git checkout -b feature/ui-improvements
# Friend works on UI changes
git add .
git commit -m "Improve UI components and styling"
git push origin feature/ui-improvements
```

### **Step 2: Daily Sync Strategy**

```bash
# Every morning, both of you should:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-feature-branch
git rebase main  # This keeps your branch up-to-date
```

### **Step 3: Merge Strategy**

```bash
# When ready to merge (you first):
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/authentication-setup
git push origin main

# Then your friend:
git checkout main
git pull origin main  # Gets your changes
git checkout feature/ui-improvements
git rebase main  # Applies your changes to their branch
git checkout main
git merge feature/ui-improvements
git push origin main
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Conflict Prevention Strategies**

### **1. File Ownership Strategy**

Assign specific files to each developer:

**You (Authentication & Backend):**
- `src/services/` - All service files
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- `src/components/auth/` - Auth components
- Configuration files (`.env`, `app.json`)

**Your Friend (UI & Frontend):**
- `src/screens/` - All screen files
- `src/components/` (except auth)
- `src/navigation/` - Navigation structure
- Styling and UI components

### **2. Communication Protocol**

**Before starting work:**
```bash
# Check what the other person is working on
git log --oneline -10
git status
```

**Daily check-in:**
- Share what files you're modifying
- Coordinate on shared components
- Discuss any breaking changes

### **3. Atomic Commits**

Make small, focused commits:

```bash
# Good: Small, focused commits
git add src/services/authService.ts
git commit -m "Fix authentication service login method"

# Bad: Large commits with multiple changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix everything"
```

## üîß **Merge Conflict Resolution**

### **When Conflicts Happen:**

1. **Don't panic!** Conflicts are normal in collaboration
2. **Communicate immediately** with your friend
3. **Resolve together** if possible

### **Conflict Resolution Steps:**

```bash
# 1. See what files have conflicts
git status

# 2. Open conflicted files and look for markers:
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# Your changes
# =======
# Friend's changes
# >>>>>>> branch-name

# 3. Edit the file to resolve conflicts
# 4. Remove conflict markers
# 5. Test the resolution
# 6. Commit the resolution
git add resolved-file.tsx
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in file.tsx"
```

### **Conflict Resolution Tools:**

```bash
# Use VS Code's built-in merge tool
code .

# Or use command line merge tool
git mergetool

# For complex conflicts, use:
git difftool
```

## üìÅ **File-Specific Strategies**

### **High-Risk Files - Coordinate Changes:**

**`src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`:**
- If you need to add auth logic, create a separate hook
- If friend needs to change UI, coordinate the changes
- Consider creating separate components

**`src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`:**
- Coordinate any navigation changes
- Use feature flags for new routes
- Test navigation thoroughly

**`src/components/`:**
- Create new components instead of modifying existing ones
- Use composition over modification
- Document component interfaces

### **Safe Files - Can Modify Independently:**

**`src/services/`:**
- You can modify freely
- Add new services without conflicts
- Update existing services carefully

**`src/contexts/`:**
- Add new contexts safely
- Modify existing contexts with coordination

---

## üö® **Emergency Procedures**

### **If Major Conflicts Occur:**

1. **Stop all work immediately**
2. **Communicate with your friend**
3. **Create backup branches:**

```bash
# Create backup of current work
git checkout -b backup/your-work-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push origin backup/your-work-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Create backup of friend's work
git checkout -b backup/friend-work-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push origin backup/friend-work-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

4. **Reset to last known good state:**
```bash
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Go back one commit
```

5. **Re-apply changes carefully:**
```bash
# Cherry-pick specific commits
git cherry-pick commit-hash
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Development Best Practices**

### **1. Before Starting Work:**

```bash
# Always start with:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### **2. During Development:**

```bash
# Commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

# Push regularly
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### **3. Before Merging:**

```bash
# Test your changes
npm test  # If you have tests
npx expo start --localhost

# Rebase to get latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase main
```

### **4. After Merging:**

```bash
# Clean up
git checkout main
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```

## üìû **Communication Protocol**

### **Daily Standup (5 minutes):**
- What did you work on yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- Any conflicts or issues?

### **Before Major Changes:**
- Share your plans
- Discuss impact on shared files
- Coordinate timing

### **When Conflicts Happen:**
- Stop work immediately
- Communicate the issue
- Resolve together
- Test the resolution

---

## üéØ **Quick Start Commands**

### **For You (Authentication work):**
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/auth-setup
# Work on authentication
git add .
git commit -m "Add authentication setup"
git push origin feature/auth-setup
```

### **For Your Friend (UI work):**
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/ui-changes
# Work on UI
git add .
git commit -m "Improve UI components"
git push origin feature/ui-changes
```

### **When Ready to Merge:**
```bash
# You merge first
git checkout main
git merge feature/auth-setup
git push origin main

# Friend merges after
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/ui-changes
git rebase main
git checkout main
