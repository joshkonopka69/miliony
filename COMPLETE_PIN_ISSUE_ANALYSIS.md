# 🔍 COMPLETE PIN ISSUE ANALYSIS

## Current Status from Logs

### ✅ What's Working:
- **3 events exist** in database with status 'active'
- **Events have valid coordinates** (Wrocław)
- **MapTestComponent finds 3 events** successfully
- **Debug logs are working** and showing data flow

### ❌ What's Broken:
- **MapScreen query returns 0 events** (not even being called)
- **No pins show on map** because no events reach GoogleMapsView
- **fetchEventsFromSupabase() might not be running**

## 🔍 Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: MapScreen fetchEventsFromSupabase() Not Being Called
**Symptoms:** 
- See "🔄 Fetching events from Supabase..." but no detailed logs
- MapScreen shows 0 events being passed

**Debug:** Added logs to track if function is called:
```
🔄 MapScreen: About to call fetchEventsFromSupabase
🔄 MapScreen: Starting fetchEventsFromSupabase function
🔄 MapScreen: About to query events table
🔄 MapScreen: Query completed. Data: X events
```

**Solution:** If logs don't appear, the function isn't being called

### Issue 2: Supabase Query Error (Silent Failure)
**Symptoms:**
- Function is called but returns 0 events
- No error messages in logs

**Debug:** Check for:
```
🔄 MapScreen: Query error: [error object]
```

**Solutions:**
- **RLS (Row Level Security)**: Events table might have policies blocking queries
- **Authentication**: User might not be authenticated
- **Table permissions**: User might not have SELECT permission

### Issue 3: Different Supabase Client/Connection
**Symptoms:**
- MapTestComponent works (finds 3 events)
- MapScreen doesn't work (finds 0 events)
- Both use same query but different results

**Possible Causes:**
- **Different Supabase client instances**
- **Different authentication contexts**
- **Caching issues**

### Issue 4: EnhancedInteractiveMap Overriding Events
**Symptoms:**
- MapScreen fetches events successfully
- EnhancedInteractiveMap receives 0 events
- Component has its own loadEvents() function

**Debug:** Check if EnhancedInteractiveMap is calling its own loadEvents() instead of using the props

### Issue 5: GoogleMapsView Not Rendering Markers
**Symptoms:**
- Events reach GoogleMapsView successfully
- No pins appear on map
- Coordinates might be invalid

**Debug:** Check coordinates are valid numbers, not null/undefined

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Debugging

### Step 1: Check if MapScreen Function is Called
**Look for these logs:**
```
🔄 MapScreen: About to call fetchEventsFromSupabase
🔄 MapScreen: Starting fetchEventsFromSupabase function
```

**If missing:** Function not being called - check useEffect dependencies

### Step 2: Check Supabase Query Results
**Look for these logs:**
```
🔄 MapScreen: Query completed. Data: X events
🔄 MapScreen: Query error: [error]
```

**If 0 events:** Query issue - check RLS, permissions, authentication
**If error:** Authentication or permission issue

### Step 3: Check Event Data Structure
**Look for:**
```
📊 Events data: [array of events with coordinates]
```

**If missing coordinates:** Run `SET_EVENTS_TO_WROCLAW.sql` again

### Step 4: Check GoogleMapsView Rendering
**Look for:**
```
🗺️ GoogleMapsView received events: [array]
🗺️ GoogleMapsView events count: X
```

**If 0 events:** Issue between EnhancedInteractiveMap and GoogleMapsView
**If events but no pins:** Issue with marker rendering or coordinates

## 🚀 Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Run SQL Script to Verify Events
```sql
SELECT id, title, status, latitude, longitude FROM events WHERE status = 'active';
```

### Fix 2: Check RLS Policies
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'events';
```

### Fix 3: Disable RLS Temporarily (for testing)
```sql
ALTER TABLE events DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Fix 4: Force Refresh App
- Shake phone → Reload
- Or press 'r' in terminal

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Reload the app** and check for the new debug logs
2. **Send me the complete log output** with all the 🔄 and 🗺️ messages
3. **I'll identify the exact issue** based on which logs appear/missing

The new debug logs will show us exactly where the data is getting lost!
