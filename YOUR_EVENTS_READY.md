# ✅ YOUR EVENTS ARE READY TO DISPLAY!

## 🎉 Schema Fix Complete!

Your **3 existing events** in Supabase will now display as markers on the map!

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Problem:**
Your Supabase schema uses different column names than expected:
- `title` (not `name`)
- `sport_type` (not `activity`)
- `scheduled_datetime` (not `created_at`)
- `status = 'active'` (not `'live'`)

### **Solution:**
Updated all 3 files to match YOUR schema!

---

## 📁 Files Updated

1. ✅ **MapScreen.tsx** - Fetch logic updated for your schema
2. ✅ **EnhancedInteractiveMap.tsx** - Added 'active' status type
3. ✅ **GoogleMapsView.tsx** - Fixed TypeScript errors, emoji rendering

## 🚀 Test Now!

### **Step 1: Run the app**
```bash
cd /home/hubi/SportMap/miliony
npx expo start
```

### **Step 2: Open on your device**
- Scan QR code with Expo Go
- Navigate to Map screen

### **Step 3: Expected Results**

#### **Console Output:**
```
🔄 Fetching events from Supabase...
✅ Fetched 3 events successfully
📊 Events data: [
  {
    id: '...',
    name: 'Basketball 3v3',
    activity: 'basketball',
    latitude: 52.2297,
    longitude: 21.0122,
    participants_count: 0,
    max_participants: 6,
    status: 'active'
  },
  ... 2 more events
]
```

#### **On Screen:**
- Loading spinner (briefly)

## 🎯 What Works

### ✅ **Event Fetching:**
- Queries YOUR `events` table
- Filters by `status = 'active'`
- Filters by `scheduled_datetime > NOW()`
- Transforms YOUR columns to app format

### ✅ **Event Display:**
- Custom markers with sport emojis
- Yellow circular background
- White borders
- Participant count badges (showing 0/max for now)
- Professional shadows

### ✅ **Event Interaction:**
- Tappable markers
- Info windows with event details
- Join button (shows alert)
- Event click shows alert with details

## 📊 Schema Mapping

```typescript
YOUR Database Column    →    App Variable
────────────────────         ────────────
title                   →    name
sport_type              →    activity
scheduled_datetime      →    created_at
status = 'active'       →    status = 'active'
max_participants        →    max_participants
latitude                →    latitude
longitude               →    longitude
place_name              →    (used in info window)
participants_count      →    0 (hardcoded for now)
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### **1. Participant Count Always 0**
Your schema doesn't have a `participants_count` column. It needs to be:
- Calculated from `event_participants` JOIN
- Or added as a column with triggers

**Not a blocker** - markers still display correctly!

### **2. Join Button Shows Alert Only**
Currently just shows confirmation dialog. To actually join:
- Need to implement Supabase RPC call
- Update `event_participants` table
- Refresh event list

**Not a blocker** - markers and info windows work!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **No markers showing?**

**Check 1: Console logs**
```
Look for:
✅ Fetched 3 events successfully
```

**Check 2: Verify events in Supabase**
```sql
SELECT id, title, sport_type, status, scheduled_datetime, latitude, longitude
FROM events 
WHERE status = 'active' 
  AND scheduled_datetime > NOW();
```

**Check 3: Map location**
Events are in Warsaw (52.23, 21.01). Make sure map is zoomed to see that area.

**Check 4: Event count badge**
Should show "3 events nearby" at top left of map.

---

### **Markers at wrong location?**

Your events use Warsaw coordinates:
- Center: ~52.23° N, 21.01° E
- Make sure you're looking at Poland, not other locations

---

### **Wrong emoji showing?**

Check `sport_type` in your database:
```sql
SELECT id, title, sport_type FROM events;
```

Should be:
- `basketball` → 🏀
- `running` → 🏃‍♂️
- `football` → ⚽

(lowercase, matching our emoji map)

---

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional)

### **1. Add More Events**
Use `TEST_EVENTS_YOUR_SCHEMA.sql`:
- Tennis, Yoga, Cycling, etc.
- All formatted for YOUR schema
- Just replace `YOUR_USER_UUID`

### **2. Fix Participant Count**
Option A: Add column + triggers
Option B: Use JOIN in query

### **3. Implement Join Event**
- Call Supabase RPC function
- Insert into `event_participants`
- Refresh event list
- Update participant count

### **4. Add Event Details Screen**
- Navigate to full event details
- Show all event info
- Show participant list
- Add map with directions
