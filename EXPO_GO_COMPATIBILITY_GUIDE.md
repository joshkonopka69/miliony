## 🚀 How to Run in Expo Go

### Option 1: Use the Script
```bash
cd miliony
./scripts/start-expo-go.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Commands
```bash
cd miliony
npm install
npx expo start --clear
```

### Option 3: Direct Expo Commands
```bash
cd miliony
npm start
# Then press 'w' for web or scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

## 📱 Testing in Expo Go

1. **Install Expo Go** on your phone from App Store/Play Store
2. **Start the development server** using one of the methods above
3. **Scan the QR code** with Expo Go app
4. **Test the app** - all features should work in Expo Go

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Maps Functionality:
- Maps will work in Expo Go using the new `expo-maps` package
- Some advanced map features might be limited compared to native maps
- For production, consider using EAS Build for full native functionality

### Authentication:
- Google Sign-In now uses OAuth 2.0 flow
- Users will be redirected to browser for authentication
- Session persistence is handled differently

### Development vs Production:
- **Expo Go**: Great for development and testing
- **EAS Build**: Required for production with full native features

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Create .env file in miliony directory
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If maps don't work:
1. Check that `expo-maps` is properly installed
2. Verify the plugin is added to `app.config.js`
3. Try clearing cache: `npx expo start --clear`

### If authentication fails:
1. Verify Google Client ID is set correctly
2. Check that redirect URI is configured in Google Console
3. Ensure `expo-auth-session` is properly installed

### If app won't start:
1. Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install`
2. Clear Expo cache: `npx expo start --clear`
3. Check for any remaining incompatible dependencies

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** in Expo Go
2. **Set up environment variables** for production
3. **Consider EAS Build** for production deployment
4. **Update any remaining native dependencies** if found

## 🎉 Success!

Your app should now run perfectly in Expo Go! 🚀
