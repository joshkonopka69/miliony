# 🧹 SportMap Cleanup Recommendations

## 📊 Analysis Summary

I've analyzed your SportMap project and identified **files that can be safely deleted** to clean up your workspace. Here's what I found:

---

## 🗑️ **SAFE TO DELETE - Documentation Files**

### **Old Implementation Guides (28 files)**
These are documentation files from previous development phases:

```

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED CLEANUP ORDER**

1. **Start with Documentation** (safest, biggest impact)
2. **Delete SQL files** (old setup files)
3. **Delete unused screens** (check navigation first)
4. **Delete unused components** (check imports first)
5. **Delete analytics/security directories** (entire feature sets)

---

## 🔍 **VERIFICATION**

After cleanup, verify your app still works:
```bash
cd /home/hubi/SportMap/miliony
npx expo start
```

Check that:
- ✅ Map screen loads
- ✅ Profile screen works
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ No import errors

---

## 📈 **BENEFITS**

- **Cleaner codebase** - Easier to navigate
- **Faster builds** - Less files to process
- **Reduced confusion** - No duplicate/unused files
- **Better organization** - Only active code remains
- **Easier maintenance** - Clear project structure
